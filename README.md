# [fitie]

[![NPM Version][npm-img]][npm] [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci]

[fitie] is an [object-fit] polyfill for Internet Explorer browsers.

The `object-fit` property defines how an element responds to the height and width of its content box. It’s intended for images, videos and other embeddable media formats.

It includes a simple window resize watcher.

To start using `object-fit` in Internet Explorer 8 - 11, add an `object-fit` property to your CSS file.

```css
img.cover, video.cover {
	object-fit: cover;
}
```

Then, somewhere in the document, include a link to [fitie].

```html
<script src="fitie.js"></script>
```

`window.fitie.test()` - You can progamatically run this to start re-evalutating page elements. For example, if the DOM updates.

That’s it. Enjoy!
